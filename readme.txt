Approach 1: baseline: GRU is in \code\activity_prediction_GRU_baseline.py

Approach 2: experimental: Convolutional LSTM is in \code\activity_prediction_cnn_lstm_experimental.py

Approach 3: experimental: Separalble Convolutional LSTM classifier is in \code\activity_prediction_separable_convolution_experimental.py

Main Approach: is in \code\activity_prediction.py.
This model worked best for me with respect to speed, accuracy and convergence. 

Model parameters are in \code\model_para.pth

I have also stored my best model in \code\best.pth
